Welcome to my High-Level Programming Language Learning Repository. This repository serves as a storage space and learning path at Holberton School France to learn and master high-level programming languages, including Python.

This repository is a collection of numerous repositories, each of which focuses on a specific high-level programming language. The primary language focused on is Python, but other languages are covered as well.

## Purpose
The aim of this repository is to provide an easy-to-follow, structured, and comprehensive path to learning high-level programming languages.
