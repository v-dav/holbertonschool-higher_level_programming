# :snake: Python - import & modules

## üìñ Learning objectives
At the end of this project, I'am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to import functions from another file
- How to use imported functions
- How to create a module
- How to use the built-in function dir()
- How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
- How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## ‚öôÔ∏è List of files
- 0-add.py: a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3
- 1-calculation.py: a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.
- 2-args.py: a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.
- 3-infinite_add.py: a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments
- 4-hidden_discovery.py: a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).
- 5-variable_load.py: a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.
- 100-my_calculator.py: a program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations.
- 101-easy_print.py: a program that prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output.
- 102-magic_calculation.py: the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as the provided Python bytecode
