 How to Use 101-lazy_matrix_mul.py
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul = __import__('101-lazy_matrix_mul').lazy_matrix_mul

Normal Use
===============================

>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
[[ 7 10]
 [15 22]]

>>> print(lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]]))
[[13 16]]

First argument is not a list
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul(2, [[2, 5]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: Scalar operands are not allowed, use '*' instead

Second argument is not a list
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[2, 5]], "Hello")
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: Scalar operands are not allowed, use '*' instead

First argument is an empty matrix
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[]], [[2, 5]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: matmul: Input operand 1 has a mismatch in its core dimension 0, with gufunc signature (n?,k),(k,m?)->(n?,m?) (size 1 is different from 0)

Second argument is an empty list
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[2, 5]], [])
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: matmul: Input operand 1 has a mismatch in its core dimension 0, with gufunc signature (n?,k),(k,m?)->(n?,m?) (size 0 is different from 2)

First argument is a list but not a matrix
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[5, 10], "Bonjour"], [[2, 5]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (2,) + inhomogeneous part.

Second argument is a list but not a matrix
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[5, 10]], [[2, 5], "Bonjour"])
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (2,) + inhomogeneous part.

Rows of first matrix are not equal
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [1, 2, 3]], [[5, 10], [10, 20]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (2,) + inhomogeneous part.

Rows of second matrix are not equal
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [1, 5]], [[5, 10], [10, 20, 30]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (2,) + inhomogeneous part.

First matrix contains not only integers or floats
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2.5], [1, "Taieb"]], [[5, 10], [10, 20]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
numpy.core._exceptions._UFuncNoLoopError: ufunc 'matmul' did not contain a loop with signature matching types (dtype('<U32'), dtype('int64')) -> None

Second matrix contains not only integers or floats
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2.5], [1, 15.75]], [[5, [5, 456]], [10, 20]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 2 dimensions. The detected shape was (2, 2) + inhomogeneous part.

Nb of columns of the first matrix is not equal
to the nomber of rows of the second matrix
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3, 4]], [[10, 20], [30, 40]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: matmul: Input operand 1 has a mismatch in its core dimension 0, with gufunc signature (n?,k),(k,m?)->(n?,m?) (size 2 is different from 4)

Missing one argument
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: lazy_matrix_mul() missing 1 required positional argument: 'm_b'

Missing two arguments
===============================

>>> lazy_matrix_mul()
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: lazy_matrix_mul() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'm_a' and 'm_b'
